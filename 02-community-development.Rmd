# Community development

## Roles

Our lessons are intended to be teachable by any certified
Carpentries Instructor with the appropriate domain experience
and background knowledge. Lessons should also be appropriate for
learners at different institutions, and not require specialized
local or institutional knowledge. Our lessons attain this 
broad usability by virtue of being the product of many people
at differnt institutions around the world who work together
in different roles to create, test, and iteratively improve and
update lesson materials. 

### Lesson Authors

A lesson may have one or several initial authors. Authors draft
the lesson content, figures, and code and create appropriate challenge problems. Authors should have both appropriate domain
experience - working in the same field as the intended audience for the materials,
and programmatic experience - regularly using the tools for which they are
developing lessons in their own work. From a technical standpoint, authors
will also need to be familiar with specific technologies that we use for 
developing and hosting The Carpentries lessons - including git, GitHub, Markdown,
RMarkdown, ... But don't panic! If you're not comfortable with any or all of these
tools, we'll walk you through what you need to know to use them [later in this
Handbook](link). Most importantly, to ensure that lesson materials are consistent with The Carpentries vision and
values, 
lesson authors should be certified Carpentries Instructors or otherwise involved
in The Carpentries community. If a group of authors are writing a lesson
collaboratively, we recommend dividing lessons up by episode, and having only one
author per episode. Clearly defining the learning objectives for each episode
will help avoid overlap and ensure the lesson flows smoothly - but it will
still be important to have regular checkins with all authors. 

### Reviewers

No one is perfect! Lesson materials should be read and tested by at least
one person other than the original author before being used in a pilot workshop. 
If a lesson has more than one author, 


- Reviewers - test lesson code and text before intial teaching. continue to provide review as materials are piloted and taught broadly
- Curriculum Advisors - provide oversight, vision, and leadership for a curriculum. Guide updates. 
- Maintainers - implement community suggestions as appropriate, ensure that lessons remain bug and typo free and are continously teachable.
- Pilot Instructors - teach
