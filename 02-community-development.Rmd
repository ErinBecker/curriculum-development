# Community development

## Roles

Our lessons are intended to be teachable by any certified
Carpentries Instructor with the appropriate domain experience
and background knowledge. Lessons should also be appropriate for
learners at different institutions, and not require specialized
local or institutional knowledge. Our lessons attain this 
broad usability by virtue of being the product of many people
at differnt institutions around the world who work together
in different roles to create, test, and iteratively improve and
update lesson materials. 

### Lesson Authors

A lesson may have one or several initial authors. Authors draft
the lesson content, figures, and code and create appropriate challenge problems. Authors should have both appropriate domain
experience - working in the same field as the intended audience for the materials,
and programmatic experience - regularly using the tools for which they are
developing lessons in their own work. From a technical standpoint, authors
will also need to be familiar with specific technologies that we use for 
developing and hosting The Carpentries lessons - including git, GitHub, Markdown,
RMarkdown, ... But don't panic! If you're not comfortable with any or all of these
tools, we'll walk you through what you need to know to use them [later in this
Handbook](link). Most importantly, to ensure that lesson materials are consistent with The Carpentries vision and
values, 
lesson authors should be certified Carpentries Instructors or otherwise involved
in The Carpentries community. If a group of authors are writing a lesson
collaboratively, we recommend dividing lessons up by episode, and having only one
author per episode. Clearly defining the learning objectives for each episode
will help avoid overlap and ensure the lesson flows smoothly - but it will
still be important to have regular checkins with all authors. 

### Reviewers

We know no one is perfect! Lesson materials should be read and tested by at least
one person other than the original author before being used in a pilot workshop. 
If a lesson has more than one author, co-authors can review each other's content. 
Community members can also serve as reviewers. A reviewer commits to carefully
reading and testing all code for a lesson or set of episodes and leaving detailed
feedback for lesson authors to correct any errors or other issues found. This feedback is 
provided as issues and/or pull requests (PRs) in the lesson's GitHub repository 
(we'll explain all of that soon!). Authors modify the lessons based on reviewer feedback to ensure the 
lesson is bug-free, all code runs as expected, exercises are appropriate and test
only the concepts being taught, and in general that the lesson is ready to be
delivered to learners in a pilot workshop.

Don't worry - this review stage is not the only point at which lessons will
receive feedback. Our collaborative lesson development model ensures that 
Instructors and other community members will continue to engage with the lesson 
materials at all stages of their development and provide near real-time feedback
to keep the lessons in good shape for as long as they are actively being taught!

### Lesson Maintainers


- Curriculum Advisors - provide oversight, vision, and leadership for a curriculum. Guide updates. 
- Maintainers - implement community suggestions as appropriate, ensure that lessons remain bug and typo free and are continously teachable.
- Pilot Instructors - teach
