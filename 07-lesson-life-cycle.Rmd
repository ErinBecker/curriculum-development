# The lesson life-cycle

* Definitions of alpha, beta, 1.0
  - Alpha: The stage that it is in the first time it is taught. (in house)
  - Beta: The stage that it is in after the pilots and clean-up. (wider community)
  - pre-release: The stage that it is in after initial publication. (anyone)
  - stable:
* Announcements 
  - letting the community know that the lesson is being prepared for release and what that means
  - Advertising for Bug BBQ
* Bug BBQ
  - How to organize for, how to schedule
  - Communications (when and how to announce)
  - Prep (communicating with maintainers about the process)
  - Facilitating communications during the actual event (real time communications, issue assignments, avoiding duplication of work)
  - Clean-up (maintainers, staff, authors)
    + Lesson release checklist
* Pre-Release Release
* How to communicate about a release

## Overview of the process

In general, when creating a lesson for The Carpentries, an individual or a small group of people start developing a lesson. From there, they teach it, use the feedback from the learners and from their experience teaching the lesson to improve it. They may go through this iterative process a few times. After that, people not involved in initial development efforts may start contributing to the lesson, and yet others may start teaching it. After a few monthsAt this stage, the lesson is mature enough and documented enough so that anyone interested can teach it.


## Pathway for community-developed lessons

### Initial contact

If you have an idea for a lesson you think would be appropriate for The Carpentries, the first step is to email [the Curriculum Development Team](mailto:curriculum@carpentries.org) to determine whether someone is already working on a similar lesson. If not, and if the Curriculum Development Team expresses interest in the lesson, the Curriculum Development Team and other members of the Carpentries community will assit you in preparing a short proposal (see below).

### The lesson proposal

Your proposal will be submitted as a pull request on the [proposals](https://github.com/carpentrieslab/proposals) repository in the Carpentries Lab organization. The Curriculum Development Team will assign an Editor for your lesson, who will provide guidance in the lesson development process, answer questions that may arise during the development, and coordinate the review process for your lesson. Your proposal will be public. The review process on your proposal will be open: all comments will be visible to all community members. Community members who wish to join the proposal or support it in other ways may do so at this point.

### Early development ("Pre-Alpha")

If your proposal is accepted, we will publish the reviewed and revised version of your proposal on The Carpentries websites. We will give you write access to the GitHub Carpentries Lab organization to create a repository where you can start the development of your lesson for which you will use our lesson template, and follow The Carpentries lesson development guidelines. Your lesson will be in the "Pre-Alpha" stage.

As lesson development progresses, you will report monthly to the Editor for your lesson. You will work with your handling Editor to set a date to teach the lesson for the first time. The Editor will provide general feedback on the content and structure of the lesson and ensure that it is ready to be taught.

### The field test ("Alpha")

When the lesson is taught for the first time, it will enter the "Alpha" stage. Field-testing a lesson is a good opportunity to receive feedback from learners who attended the lesson, instructors who taught it, and developers who can compare their expectations to the reality. The initial feedback gathered during the first time a lesson is taught is really important. The Carpentries Assessment Team will work with you to develop surveys to gather feedback from your learners, helpers, and instructors. The Curriculum Development Team and the Editor for the lesson will review the feedback with you, and help you decide how to incorporate this feedback in your lesson.

The Carpentries Community Manager will make an announcement that a new "Alpha" lesson is available to contribute to and can be taught by instructors interested in early-adoption of the lesson.

After a few iteration of teaching/integrating feedback (and at least 2 early pilots), you will let the Carpentries Editor know that your lesson is ready to be officially reviewed. The Editor will select 2-3 people within our community with teaching experience and/or appropriate domain expertise, who will provide an open, friendly review of your lesson. After incorporating feedback and comments from the reviewers, your lesson will be "stamped" Carpentries-reviewed and will be listed on our websites as such.

During this process, you will have the possibility to include a short paper describing your lesson in the GitHub repository and have your lesson considered for publication in JOSE. Once your lesson has gone through the peer-review process and has been approved by the editor, we will create an official Zenodo release for it, and the lesson will enter the "Beta" stage.

### The Beta stage

The "Beta" stage lasts 6 months. During this time, we let members of our community teach it and contribute to the content of the lesson. Around the 4th month in this stage, you will organize a "Lesson Polishing" event (aka Bug BBQ). The main goal of this phase of the lesson development is to develop the documentation needed to ensure that people who have not contributed to the initial development efforts of the lesson have enough information to teach it effectively.

After a final check from one of The Carpentries' Editors, we will create a stable release for the lesson that will be listed on our website. Anyone in our community, including our local Carpentries communities, will be able to use the lesson in their workshops or meetups. We will generate new releases every 6 months.
