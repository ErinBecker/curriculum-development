<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Carpentries mindset to curriculum development</h2>
<p>Developing a Carpentry curriculum is based on the results of research in the science of learning and the science of teaching. We rely on the findings synthesized in the Ambrose et al.Â book âHow learning worksâ. We recommend this book as part of our Instructor training, so Instructors can understand why we teach the way we do, and why our lessons are designed the way they are.</p>
<p>The authors identify 7 principles (direct quotation from the book in bold):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>âStudentsâ prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.â</strong> â Identifying
what the learners know before coming to our workshops help us adjust what we
teach. One way we do this is through our pre-workshop surveys. Regular
challenges throughout our lessons help Instructors and Learners identify
misconceptions.</li>
<li><strong>âHow students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what
they know.â</strong> â We aim to design our lessons in chunks (the episodes) that
contain about 7 key concepts (+/- 2). This is about the maximum amount of
information that can be held in short-term memory. These chunks should not
contain more information in order for learners to have an opportunity to
practice how to use these new concepts, how they are related to each others,
how they can be integrated with previously covered concepts. Chunking allows
Learners to have a chance to organize effectively this new knowledge,
increasing the likelihood of being retrieved successfully in new contexts.</li>
<li><strong>âStudentsâ motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to
learn.â</strong> â Our Learners are motivated to learn the concepts taught in our
workshops. They realize they need the skills we teach to conduct their
research more effectively. They have experienced the pain that comes with
copying and pasting data across spreadsheets, or having to re-do complex
graphs over and over as new data come in. However, they may also be
intimidated by how much they have to learn before being proficient
programmers and data analysts. Two of our strategies to motivate our Learners
are: (1) to create a positive learning environment, and (2) to teach the most
useful skills first. We cover the former in Instructor Training, the latter below.</li>
<li><strong>âTo develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice
integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.â</strong> â For
Learners to master the skills we teach in our workshops, we include
opportunities for them to practice through our challenges. When designing our
lessons, we need to identify all the skills that are needed to answer these
challenges, and design them to incrementally combine the skills we teach.
Well-designed challenges contribute to our Learnerâs ability to transfer the
skills they acquire in our workshop to their own research.</li>
<li><strong>âGoal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality
of studentsâ learning.â</strong> â [this paragraph needs to be rewritten/re-thought;
it doesnât cover the skill of being able to recognize an answer that might be
wrong/incorrect]. When Learners try to solve the challenges we include in our
lessons they receive direct feedback from the computer. Either they get an
error message or the expected answer. The negative feedback from error message
does not inform learners on their learning process. They can also be
frustrating and demotivating. When designing challenges to be included in the
lessons, completing them successfully should provide direct positive feedback
to the students that they are acquiring the skills that are being taught in
the workshop. To do so, challenges should be formulated to only use skills
that have already been introduced during the workshop, and with a limited
range of possible answers.</li>
<li><strong>âStudentsâ current level of development interacts with the social,
emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.â</strong> â A
workshopâs positive environment makes our learners thrive and is more likely
to increase their confidence in their ability to use the skills we teach.
Creating a positive environment is a shared responsibility between all
participants: Instructors, Helpers, and Learners. Setting up expectations by
having and enforcing our Code of Conduct contributes to making the workshop
space welcoming for everyone. Other strategies that the Carpentries use such
as the green sitckies, are outlined in Instructor Training. When it comes to
the content for the curriculum, creating a positive environment means that
examples chosen cannot be alienating, that the skill level is appropriate for
the audience, and the examples and challenges are leading to outcomes with
direct applications for our learners. For instance, when one of our Learners
achieve to create a visualization that they can directly apply on their own
data, it reinforces their motivation in the topic and favors a positive
climate.</li>
<li><strong>âTo become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust
their approaches to learning.â</strong> â In-person workshops allow Instructors to
model the thinking process that is needed to address the challenges that are
included in our lessons. As an Instructor, being very explicit (âthinking
aloudâ) about the steps of the mental model that are involved in identifying
the functions to use, the values of the arguments they take, and the order in
which to call these functions to solve a challenge, will help learners think
of the questions they will need to ask themselves when facing new problems to
solve. While this type of approach works for any level of complexity in the
challenges we teach, it works best for most advanced ones, where several steps
need to be integrated to come to the solution. Before reaching this level of
complexity, the challenges can be designed to guide this process, using
scaffolding. Scaffolding is the process where all the pieces of code to answer
the problem are already written but are not in the correct order (Parsonâs
problem), or fill in the blanks. This might be one of the most important
things we teach in our workshops. It can set up Learners to a successful path
to self-learning. When developing the content of the curriculum, think of the
kind of thinking process that is needed to successfully address the research
questions in your field.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of a 2-day workshop, not all of the principles outlined by the authors of âHow Learning Worksâ apply. We emphasize those that create a positive, engaging experience for our participants, and that will motivate them to learn more about the best practices and skills covered in our workshops.</p>
<p>Applying these principles require an effective commbination of how the lessons are taught (delivery) and what is included in the lessons (content). Most of aspects regarding how we deliver workshops are outlined in our Instructor Training. Before diving into creating lesson content, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with some of the concepts included in our Instructor Training curriculum. In this handbook, we focus on how to design the content of our workshops.</p>
</div>
<div id="backward-and-learner-centered-lesson-design" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Backward and Learner-centered lesson design</h2>
<p>Analogy with drawing: you want to draw the outline before filling the details.</p>
<p>We use a backward lesson design:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We identify the practical skills we aim to teach.</li>
<li>We design challenges to give an opportunity for our learners to practice and
integrate these skills.</li>
<li>We identify what we need to teach for our learners to acquire these skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using this approach ensures that all the skills we teach work together to meet the over-arching goal of our lesson and our curriculum. It also limits the risk of not teaching a concept needed to be able to master the skills we aim to teach. Similarly, it avoids teaching topics that do not help us meet our goals.</p>
<p>Reducing distractions is part of our lesson design as we strive to reduce cognitive load on learners. To this end, we also develop our lessons to be centered around a narrative and a dataset they can relate with quickly.</p>
<p>Because our workshops are domain-specific, the data we use, and the type of questions we ask with the data are already somewhat familiar to our learners. Their energy and focus can be directed towards learning the skills we teach rather than getting familiar with data and concepts that are foreign to them. This strategy also increases the motivation of our learners. By learning how to solve problems that are familiar to them, they can more easily transpose these skills directly to their own data, and make a good starting point to continue their learning process as they try to solve new or more complex problems with their own data.</p>
<div id="how-to-identify-the-practical-skills" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> How to identify the practical skills?</h3>
<p>Above all, in a Carpentries workshop, our aim is to increase the confidence of our Learners. We want to demystify and make accessible the process of computing and analyzing data. A fraction of people attending our workshops have little to no coding experience. Attending an in-person workshop provides an opportunity to try, in a friendly-environment, something they perceive as intimidating. [FIXME Does Kari have data on this?]</p>
<p>Another important goal is to make the research life of our learners easier. We emphasize best practices. The kind of skills that are difficult to learn from a Google search. Teaching defensive programming, how to use spreadsheets effectively, or how to organize files consistently across research projects, are practical skills that can save a lot time when learners apply them in their own research.</p>
<p>When deciding what to teach, try to identify the skills that are the most useful and have the highest impact first. Having domain-specific workshops has the advantage that we can adapt the content of the workshops to reflect what the most useful and high-impact skills are for each domains.</p>
<p>The lessons should be designed to create frequent opportunities for Learners to practice the skills taught while exemplifying the tasks they perform in their daily research lives. Live coding and hands-on challenges that Learners can directly relate to should allow them to project how they can start using the skills taught with their own data as soon as the workshop is over.</p>
<p>Teaching the most useful in a practical way aims at encouraging continued learning after attending a workshop. Additionally, we have found that having local communities created by Instructors and Learners, provide a resource and support group that fosters this culture of continuous and continued learning.</p>
<p>As you are planning the design of your lesson material identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which skills do I use daily in my research workflow?</li>
<li>Which skills do I use in combination/do I integrate to perform common tasks?</li>
<li>What are the specificities of the data, datasets, and metadata used in my
research?</li>
<li>What are the tools, libraries, packages that are typical of my domain?</li>
<li>What is the life cycle of my data: How is the data transformed and analyzed
from acquisition to publication and archival?</li>
</ul>
<p>As an expert in your field, there might be mutliple steps involved in your analysis that you have become so used to, that you might not recognize them as separate steps (expert blind spot, fluid representation). When designing the content of your lesson and curriculum, it is crucial that you identify these intermediate steps that will need to be taught to novices in the field.</p>
<p>It is also however important when building the lesson to organize the content to put useful and applicable examples as early as possible. We have found that in the context of a 2-day workshop, starting with teaching how to generate high-quality plots before teaching about data types leads to more motivated Learners than doing the opposite.</p>

<ul>
<li>We donât teach Learners to be experts in 2 days, some of the complexity that
comes with expertise canât be part of our workshop. We do aim to set up the
mental model of our Learners to allow them to grow into experts in the future.
Managing this expectation is important because it limits demotivation.</li>

<div id="episodes" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1.1</span> Episodes</h4>
<p>An episode teaches one concept. It has learning objectives and exercises that âtestâ understanding of those learning objectives, essentially with summative assessment. Episodes can be used independently from each other, but often draw concepts from other episodes.</p>
</div>
<div id="lesson" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1.2</span> Lesson</h4>
<p>A lesson is a set of episodes that teaches a group of related concepts with a particular goal. There is a âlanding pageâ for the lesson that has a list of all the episodes as well as the overall learning objectives. Within a lesson, episodes should be linked together. The lesson should have learning objectives that are met by the episodes, or by linking the concepts across episodes. Assessment of outcomes is more summative, potentially in an after-workshop survey. (We donât necessarily have a way of âtestingâ lesson-level learning objectives). Lessons can be used independently and should not rely on concepts from other lessons. A lesson can be constructed in a variety of ways, by adding or removing episodes related to that lesson. However, there should be a clear recommended structure or structures.</p>
</div>
<div id="workshop" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1.3</span> Workshop</h4>
<p>A workshop is a set of connected lessons. The workshop should have goals and objectives. Objectives are evaluated in pre- and post-workshop surveys. (Although actually we donât do this so much right now, but thatâs ok). A workshop may have a narrative structure, explicitly linking lessons. Or it maybe be a set of episodes that are not explicitly linked, but work together to meet overall goals of the workshop.</p>
</div>
<div id="curriculum" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1.4</span> Curriculum</h4>
<p>A curriculum is the full set of lessons and episodes within The Carpentries, or within a Lesson Program (e.g.Â Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry), or within a Data Carpentry domain (e.g.Â Data Carpentry Social Science, Data Carpentry Geospatial). The resources within a curriculum should meet overall goals and match the audience of the domain, Lesson Program, or The Carpentries.</p>
