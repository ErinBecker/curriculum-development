# Assembling the lesson

* Picking a dataset
* Formatting a dataset to make it a teaching dataset
* How to write exercises (you)
* Different types of exercises and why / how to use them
* How to test exercises for correct level
* How to space exercises
* Writing the live code (we)
* What to write for instructor notes
* Writing the narrative around the code (I)
* How to evaluate lesson drafts for expert blind spot, correct leveling and scope
* Issue Bonanza (limited - CAC?)
* Clean-up (authors and staff)
* Put workshop page together
* We now have the alpha version of the lesson. (?)

## Picking a dataset

 have the full data publicly available, in something like FigShare
- likely good to create a teaching version of the dataset. This should also be publicly available in something like FigShare.
- representative of and relevant to researchers in the field
- large enough to represent real challenges (e.g. a tabular dataset should be larger than what would be easy to analyze in Excel. For instance Ecology dataset is ~35,000 rows.)
- complex enough to be able to ask interesting questions (e.g. at least a few variables for each observation)
- interesting and relevant in different geographies (e.g. even if it’s regionally based, other geographies should understand it without much context and find the questions compelling)
- fields and motivation for study or data collection understandable without much context
- have metadata about how the data was collected
- ideally have a publication associated with it for reference, and to demonstrate it’s actual usage in the field
