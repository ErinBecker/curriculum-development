# Deciding what to teach

As discussed in an [earlier chapter](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/conceptual-elements.html#backward-design), the first step in designing a curriculum according to backward design principles is to 
identify the practical skills that you aim to teach. This step is absolutely critical to defining the scope of 
your curriculum and to avoid [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep), both during initial writing of the lesson materials and later
community-driven development. 

## Target audience

To identify the skills you aim to teach, it is first essential to define your 
target audience, as different audiences will have different needs, as well as different starting skill sets. For
example, Data Carpentry's [Genomics workshop curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/) assumes
that learners have some background in the biological sciences and will understand biological terminology and 
abbreviations used in those lessons, but does not assume any prior experience with the tools taught in the lesson,
including The Unix Shell and Amazon Web Services. These assumptions set the stage for lesson development, by 
placing boundaries around what will and won't need to be explained in the lesson.

You probably already have some sense of your target audience. To help refine this sense, ask yourself the 
following questions. Write down your answers and see if you can clearly articulate who is and isn't included
in your audience. Share these thoughts with your colleagues and see if they agree. 

### Audience definition questions
* What is the expected educational level of your audience? - Do you expect most learners to be undergraduate 
students, graduate students, or to have completed graduate school? If you are targeting graduate students, 
do you expect learners to be new graduate students, masters degree holders, or doctoral candidates?

* What type of exposure do your audience members have to the technologies you plan to teach? - Think about the
typical course work that someone in your field has completed when they are at your targeted educational level. 
Have they had classes where they needed to use R, Python, or some other programming language for their homework?
Does your department require any courses on data organization or management? Do students in your field 
ever interact with a remote computing system? Don't worry if the answer to all of these questions is "no", 
most university departments don't build computational training into their undergraduate or graduate programs - 
which is why The Carpentries exists! Talk with others in your field, especially colleagues at different
institutions and in different countries. Having an accurate picture of your target audience's actual exposure 
to these skills will help you plan a realistic curriculum.

[Add some references to papers that conducted data skills training surveys in different domains?]

* What types of tools do they already use? - Related to the previous question, it is useful to understand 
the toolkit that your target audience is already comfortable with. Do they commonly use spreadsheet software 
like Microsoft Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheets? Are they most comfortable working in rich text editors like 
Microsoft Word or Google Docs? Do they use any web-based GUIs or databases? Having this information will help you
appropriately target your content by making useful analogies and tying new knowledge to existing knowledge. It
is also very important to understand what tools established researchers in the field are using. No matter how
enthusiastic a new doctoral student might be about using Python, if everyone else in their lab (including
their advisor) uses MatLab, they're unlikely to be successful in convincing the entire lab to change their
workflows.

* What are the pain points they are currently experiencing? - The Carpentries trainings are designed to 
meet learners where they are and help them improve their workflows in a way that is immediately useful for them.
We avoid idealism in favor of realism. Yes, it would be excellent if use of version control was standard 
across the research community, but if the learners at your workshop don't see the immediate benefit of version 
control, they are unlikely to implement it. Talk with students and other new researchers in your field. What are
the computational tasks they spend hours upon hours doing, only to have to redo when they get their reviews 
back from the publisher? What repetitive tasks do they do by hand and find mistakes in weeks or months later? 
People love to share stories like this and you can learn a lot about what others in your field are struggling with
by collecting these stories. These are the skills you should be targeting in your lesson. 

* What types of data does your target audience work with? What are the commonalities in the datasets your target audience will encounter? (types of variable, size, standard data formats, etc.) - If you're designing
a domain-specific curriculum, you'll need to consider the range of data types that members of your domain 
community work with. For example, researchers in the social sciences work with a wide range of data types, but
survey data is common in this research community. Data Carpentry elected to develop lessons around closed-ended
survey data, with the hopes of expanding this lesson set to include analysis of free-response text in the future. 
Similarly, a genomics researcher may work with data sets that span multiple species or multiple individuals or 
populations within a species. The Data Carpentry Genomics curriculum development team chose to focus on 
intra-species data sets. Researchers in the field who work with different data types will still be able to 
benefit from the lessons, but choosing a common data type will ensure your lesson is maximally useful for a broad
component of your domain community. It is important to make this decision early on, as trying to include every 
type of data that researchers in your field work with will result in sprawling, ungainly lessons that aren't 
useful for anyone. Choose one thing and do it well!

### Learner profiles

After thinking through the audience definition questions above, and discussing these questions with colleagues
in other institutions, you should have a fairly clear understanding of your target audience. You should now
know who you expect to show up to your workshops, what knowledge and expectations they will bring with them, 
and what their motivations are. Keeping this information front-and-center throughout the lesson development
process is incredibly important, as it is all too easy to forget your target learner and go down tangents in
your lesson that don't serve this set of learner's needs. To make your target audience more concrete, we 
recommend creating a set of learner profiles. A learner profile describes a fictional learner at your workshop 
and includes the personâ€™s general background, the problems they face, and how the course will help them. 
Software Carpentry has [example learner profiles](https://carpentries.org/audience/) that will be useful
in developing learner profiles for your own course. We recommend creating 2-4 learner profiles that describe
various segments of your target audience. These profiles can then be consulted at future stages in the 
curriculum development process. For example, when developing an exercise, you can look at your learner 
profiles and ask "Is this exercise useful for my target learners?". 

## Skills list

Congratulations! You now have a solid understanding of the users of your lesson materials and can concretely 
define the background knowledge and goals of your learners. These goals are a combination of a) reducing or 
removing pain points that your learners can self-identify and b) achieving next-level competencies that 
learners may not realize are possible, but which will be practically useful to them in their research. 
You can think of these two components as the
starting and ending points for your lesson. The background knowledge and skills that your learners bring 
to the workshop define the starting point, while your learners' goals define the end point. With these
start and end points, you can now define the list of skills that you will need to teach at your workshop. 

It is important at this stage to be sure you are defining **skills** that your learners will acquire, not
**topics** that you will teach. You may be tempted to say, for example, that learners will learn about the 
[grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html) - which places the emphasis on a **topic** that learners will learn **about** - or that they will learn how to use
the [R package ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) - which emphasizes the **tool** that learners will be
exposed to. Neither of these ways of stating the learning goal focuses on the **abilities** that learners
will develop that will help them in their work. Since you, as the lesson developer, will be using this skills
list to create exercises and lesson content, it is essential to describe specific competencies and abilities that
the content will help learners to develop. For example, this learning goal would be better phrased as 
"create plots that can be quickly and reproducibly modified and customized." If your target audience
has specific plotting needs (like creating time-series plots, or visualising very large datasets), this 
learning goal would be phrased to incorporate those specific needs. 



As you are planning the design of your lesson material identify:

* Which skills do I use daily in my research workflow?
* Which skills do I use in combination/do I integrate to perform common tasks?
* What are the specificities of the data, datasets, and metadata used in my
  research?
* What are the tools, libraries, packages that are typical of my domain?
* What is the life cycle of my data: How is the data transformed and analyzed
  from acquisition to publication and archival?
  
As an expert in your field, there might be mutliple steps involved in your analysis that you have become so used to, that you might not recognize them as separate steps (expert blind spot, fluid representation). When designing the content of your lesson and curriculum, it is crucial that you identify these intermediate steps that will need to be taught to novices in the field.

It is also however important when building the lesson to organize the content to put useful and applicable examples as early as possible. We have found that in the context of a 2-day workshop, starting with teaching how to generate high-quality plots before teaching about data types leads to more motivated learners than doing the opposite.
