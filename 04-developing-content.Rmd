# Developing content

At this point in the lesson development process, you should have a list of the core skills that your lesson
will teach, along with a set of exercises that you will incorporate into your lesson. If you've taken the time 
to go through these steps, the remaining parts of the development process will be much more straightforward
and take less time than if you try to start with developing content. Its ok if your list of skills and set
of exercises changes a little as you develop your lesson content - none of us get it right on the first try -
however, if you've invested time in the first two steps of the backward design process,
these changes should be fairly small.

Now that we're ready to start writing the lesson material, it's worth laying out some of the fundamental
elements of a Carpentries lesson. These elements are covered in much more detail in [a later chapter](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/technological-introductions.html), so we will focus
here on the bare minimum you need to know to get started. It's perfectly ok to work through some or all of the
steps described in this chapter before worrying about the logistics of putting your materials up on GitHub, 
but if you're working with multiple authors, it may be worth putting your materials on GitHub at this stage,
to make collaboration easier. The [Technological Introductions](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/technological-introductions.html) chapter
can get you started with hosting your lesson on GitHub.  

## Fundamental elements

The bulk of a Carpentries lesson consists of exercises, example code chunks, and narrative text. You have already
developed many or all of the exercises you will include in your lesson, so congratulations on being one-third
done with content development! The remaining two major components of the lesson are described below. 

### Code chunks
Carpentries workshops are taught using participatory
live coding. Instructors
type the code as they teach it and learners type along with the Instructor. For more information about how
live coding works, and what its advantages and disadvantages are, read that section of our 
[Instructor Training program](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/index.html). The fact 
that Carpentries workshops are taught using live coding means that much of your episode content will be 
*code chunks* - short blocks of code that learners type along with the Instructor and evaluate on their own
machines. 

Since you already know the structure of your dataset, and already have your exercises in place, it's fairly
straightforward to create the code chunks for your lesson. Starting with the first exercise, make a list of each
of the commands and syntax elements that learners need to be familiar with in order to solve the exercise. For
example, the first exercise in the Data Carpentry lesson [Introduction to the Command Line for Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/) asks learners to: 

```
Use the `-l` option for the `ls` command to display more information for each item in the directory. What is one piece of additional information this long format gives you that you don’t see with the bare `ls` command?
```

In order to solve this challenge, learners need to know the following (in approximately reverse order): 
1. That options come after the command (e.g. `ls -l` not `-l ls`).
1. What the `ls` command does in its bare form. 
1. How to find the manual page for `ls` to understand the output.
1. How to navigate to the right directory.
1. How to tell what directory they're in.
1. How to open the bash shell on their machines.

That's *six* concepts or pieces of information that learners need to have to answer this challenge! If it 
didn't seem that complex to you, please revisit the idea of [expert blind spot](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/03-expertise/index.html) in our Instructor Training
curriculum. 

With this list, you can now construct the pieces of code that an Instructor will need to walk learners through
before this first exercise. Those pieces of code (in the same order as above), are something like:

1. `ls -F` (or any other commonly used `ls` option other than `ls`)
1. `ls`
1. `man ls` (or `man cd` or `man pwd`)
1. `cd`
1. `pwd`
1. Not a code chunk, but a demonstration of how to open the bash shell on the Instructor's machine. 

You now have your first set of code chunks corresponding with your first exercise. Put these in reverse order
and you're well on your way to writing your lesson!

### Narrative text

## Supporting elements

Learning objectives, key points, questions, etc. 


# Learning objectives and formative assessment

*  How to write learning objectives
  - What is Bloom's taxonomy? How to use it?
  - How to assess learner's current Bloom level? Where do we want to bring them?
  - Our lessons are mostly targeted for knowledge, understanding and applications stages. Setting constraints for where we want to build our lessons.
  - Use action words for writing learning objectives
* How to write key points and questions
* Using learning objectives to define / plan challenges (“exercise about X, including XYZ concepts”)
* Splitting lessons into episodes and into smaller concept chunks (between exercises)
* Organize learning objectives and split into related groups (lessons and episodes)
* How to identify the size of a concept to teach
* Make a list of out of scope material - this can be used for documenting for “how to say no” aspect of being a maintainer
* Get external links for these things
