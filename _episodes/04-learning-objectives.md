## Learning objectives and formative assessment

*  How to write learning objectives
  - What is Bloom's taxonomy? How to use it?
  - How to assess learner's current Bloom level? Where do we want to bring them?
  - Our lessons are mostly targeted for knowledge, understanding and applications stages. Setting constraints for where we want to build our lessons.
  - Use action words for writing learning objectives
* How to write key points and questions
* Using learning objectives to define / plan challenges (“exercise about X, including XYZ concepts”)
* Splitting lessons into episodes and into smaller concept chunks (between exercises)
* Organize learning objectives and split into related groups (lessons and episodes)
* How to identify the size of a concept to teach
* Make a list of out of scope material - this can be used for documenting for “how to say no” aspect of being a maintainer
