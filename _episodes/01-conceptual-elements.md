## Conceptual elements


* The Carpentries mindset to curriculum development - evidence-based curriculum
  development
* What are the core pedagogical concepts that are part of a Carpentry lesson?
  - Teach most useful first
  - motivation
* What are the goals of a Carpentries lesson and how do we achieve them
  increased confidence in the tools we teach
* Self-directed learning
* The open source model of development adapted for lesson 
* Collaborative lesson development. 
* Writing lessons for others to use
* Backwards lesson development / learner centered design
  - Formative assessment
* Lesson structure - workshop / lesson / episode / challenge
* What to consider when selecting a dataset
* The I, We, You model
* The idea of having a narrative to the lesson

### The Carpentries mindset to curriculum development

Developing a Carpentry curriculum is based on the results of research in the science of learning and the science of teaching. We rely on the findings synthesized in the Ambrose et al. book "How learning works". We recommend this book as part of our instructor training, so instructors can understand why we teach the way we do, and why our lessons are designed the way they are.

The authors identify 7 principles (direct quotation from the book in bold):

* **"Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning."** -- Identifying
  what the learners know before coming to our workshops help us adjust what we
  teach. One way we do this is through our pre-workshop surveys. Regular
  challenges throughout our lessons help instructors identify concepts that
  might be misunderstood by our learners.
* **"How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what
  they know."** -- We aim to design our lessons in chunks (the episodes) that
  contain about 7 key concepts (+/- 2). This is about the maximum amount of
  information that can be held in the working memory. These chunks should not
  contain more information in order for learners to have an opportunity to
  practice how to use these new concepts. This allows learners to have a chance
  to organize effectively this new knowledge, increasing the likelihood of its
  successful retrieval in new contexts.
* **"Students' motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to
  learn."** -- Most of our learners are motivated to learn the concepts taught
  in our workshops. They realize they need the skills we teach to conduct their
  research more effectively. They have experienced the pain that comes with
  copying and pasting data across spreadsheets, or making complex graphs over
  and over. However, they may also be intimidated by how much they have to learn
  before being proficient with programming and data analysis. Two of our
  strategies to motivate our learners are: (1) to create a positive learning
  environemnt, and (2) to teach the most useful skills first.
* **"To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice
  integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned."** -- For
  students to master the skills we teach in our workshops, we include
  opportunities for them to practice through our challenges. When designing our
  courses, we need to be aware of the skills needed to answer these challenges,
  and design the challenges to combine progressively the skills covered during
  our workshops. By designing challenges effectively, they contribute to develop
  the skills our learners will need when they will need to apply the skills
  taught in their research.
* **"Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality
  of students' learning."** -- When our learners try to solve the challenges we
  include in our lessons they receive direct feedback from the computer. Either
  they get an error message or the expected answer. The negative feedback from
  error message does not inform learners on their learning process. They can
  also be frustrating and demotivating. When designing challenges to be included
  in the lessons, completing them successfully should provide direct positive
  feedback to the students that they are acquiring the skills that are being
  taught in the workshop. To do so, challenges should be formulated to only use
  skills that have already been introduced during the workshop, and with a
  limited range of possible answers.
* **"Students' current level of development interacts with the social,
  emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning."** -- A
  positive workshop's environment makes our learners thrive and is more likely
  to increase their confidence in their ability to use the skills we teach.
  Creating a positive environment is a shared responsibility between all
  participants: instructors, helpers, and learners. Setting expectations by
  having and enforcing our code of conduct contributes to making the workshop
  space welcoming for everyone. Other strategies that the Carpentries use such
  as the green sitckies, are outlined in instructor training. In terms of
  content for the curriculum, creating a positive environment means that
  examples chosen are not alienating, that the skill level is appropriate for
  the audience, and we use examples and challenges leading to outcomes with
  direct applications for our learners. For instance, when one of our learners
  grasp how to create a visualization that they can directly apply on their own
  data, it favors a positive climate.
* **"To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust
  their approaches to learning."** -- It is one of the advantages of having a
  in-person workshop. Instructors can model the thinking process that is needed
  to address the challenges that are included in our lessons. As an instructor
  being very explicit ("thinking aloud") about the steps of the mental model
  that are involved in identifying the functions to use, the values of the
  arguments they take, and the order in which to call these functions to solve
  the challenge, will help learners think of the questions they will need to ask
  themselves when facing new problems to solve. While this type of approach
  works for any level of complexity in the challenges we teach, it works best
  for most advanced ones, where several steps need to be integrated to solve the
  challenge. Before reaching this level of complexity, the challenges can be
  designed to guide this process, using scaffolding. Scaffolding is the process
  where all the pieces of code to answer the problem are already written but are
  not in the correct order (Parson's problem), or fill in the blanks.
  

we emphasize some of these concepts given 2 day constraints

These principles is based on a commbination of delivery and content. Most of the delivery aspects are outlined in instructor training, here we will focus on the content of these lessons.
