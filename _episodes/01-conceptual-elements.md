## Conceptual elements


* The Carpentries mindset to curriculum development - evidence-based curriculum
  development
* What are the core pedagogical concepts that are part of a Carpentry lesson?
  - Teach most useful first
  - motivation
* What are the goals of a Carpentries lesson and how do we achieve them
  increased confidence in the tools we teach
* Self-directed learning
* The open source model of development adapted for lesson 
* Collaborative lesson development. 
* Writing lessons for others to use
* Backwards lesson development / learner centered design
  - Formative assessment
* Lesson structure - workshop / lesson / episode / challenge
* What to consider when selecting a dataset
* The I, We, You model
* The idea of having a narrative to the lesson

### The Carpentries mindset to curriculum development

Developing a Carpentry curriculum is based on the results of research in the science of learning and the science of teaching. We rely on the findings synthesized in the Ambrose et al. book "How learning works". We recommend this book as part of our instructor training, so instructors can understand why we teach the way we do, and why our lessons are designed the way they are.

The authors identify 7 principles:

* **"Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning"** -- Identifying
  what the learners know before coming to our workshops help us adjust what we
  teach. One way we do this is through our pre-workshop surveys. Regular
  challenges throughout our lessons help instructors identify concepts that
  might be misunderstood by our learners.
* **"How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what
  they know"** -- We aim to design our lessons in chunks (the episodes) that
  contain about 7 key concepts (+/- 2). This is about the maximum amount of
  information that can be held in the working memory. These chunks should not
  contain more information in order for learners to have an opportunity to
  practice how to use these new concepts. This allows learners to have a chance
  to organize effectively this new knowledge, increasing the likelihood of its
  successful retrieval to future contexts.
* **"Students' motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to
  learn"** -- Most of our learners are motivated to learn the concepts taught in
  our workshops. They realize they need the skills we teach to conduct their
  research more effectively. They have experienced the pain that comes with
  copying and pasting data across spreadsheets, or making complex graphs over
  and over. However, they may also be intimidated by how much they have to learn
  before being proficient with programming and data analysis. Two of our
  strategies to motivate our learners are: (1) to create a positive learning
  environemnt, and (2) to teach the most useful skills first.
